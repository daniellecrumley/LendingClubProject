## Background Information

The Lending Club is a peer-to-peer lending network for loans ranging from $1,000 to $40,000. The Lending Club provides a large amount of loan data online so that its investors can make their own informed investment decisions. This online data dates from 2007 to Q2 2018 and provides certain borrower demographic and credit history information, as well as loan-specific information (including the purpose of the loan, the amount requested and amount funded, the interest rate, and the loan grade assigned by the Lending Club).

## Project Aim

Note: this is from Milestone 2 and should be edited

The goal of our project is to build a model using multiple linear regression which, given the Lending Club data for a borrower, assesses the risk of investment and produces our investment recommendation: the maximum amount (in dollars) that we recommend funding. Our investment strategy should be both 1) non-discriminatory with regard to demographic factors such as race, disability status, sex, religion, and home address, and 2) effective in producing a high return on investment.
